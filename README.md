# Automated Machine Learning 

The `mljar-supervised` is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model :trophy:. It is no black box, as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model). 

The `mljar-supervised` will help you with:
 - explaining and understanding your data (Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis),
 - trying many different machine learning models (Algorithm Selection and Hyper-Parameters tuning),
 - creating Markdown reports from analysis with details about all models (Automatic-Documentation),
 - saving, re-running, and loading the analysis and ML models.

It has four built-in modes of work:
 - `Explain` mode, which is ideal for explaining and understanding the data, with many data explanations, like decision trees visualization, linear models coefficients display, permutation importance, and SHAP explanations of data,
 - `Perform` for building ML pipelines to use in production,
 - `Compete` mode that trains highly-tuned ML models with ensembling and stacking, with the purpose to use in ML competitions.
 - `Optuna` mode can be used to search for highly-tuned ML models should be used when the performance is the most important, and computation time is not limited (it is available from version `0.10.0`)

Of course, you can further customize the details of each `mode` to meet the requirements.

## What's good in it? 

- It uses many algorithms: `Baseline`, `Linear`, `Random Forest`, `Extra Trees`, `LightGBM`, `Xgboost`, `CatBoost`, `Neural Networks`, and `Nearest Neighbors`.
- It can compute Ensemble based on a greedy algorithm from [Caruana paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/shotgun.icml04.revised.rev2.pdf).
- It can stack models to build a level 2 ensemble (available in `Compete` mode or after setting the `stack_models` parameter).
- It can do features preprocessing, like missing values imputation and converting categoricals. What is more, it can also handle target values preprocessing.
- It can do advanced features engineering, like [Golden Features](https://supervised.mljar.com/features/golden_features/), [Features Selection](https://supervised.mljar.com/features/features_selection/), Text and Time Transformations.
- It can tune hyper-parameters with a `not-so-random-search` algorithm (random-search over a defined set of values) and hill climbing to fine-tune final models.
- It can compute the `Baseline` for your data so that you will know if you need Machine Learning or not!
- It has extensive explanations. This package is training simple `Decision Trees` with `max_depth <= 5`, so you can easily visualize them with amazing [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz) to better understand your data.
- The `mljar-supervised` uses simple linear regression and includes its coefficients in the summary report, so you can check which features are used the most in the linear model.
- It cares about the explainability of models: for every algorithm, the feature importance is computed based on permutation. Additionally, for every algorithm, the SHAP explanations are computed: feature importance, dependence plots, and decision plots (explanations can be switched off with the `explain_level` parameter).
- There is automatic documentation for every ML experiment run with AutoML. The `mljar-supervised` creates markdown reports from AutoML training full of ML details, metrics, and charts.

</p>

### Explain 

```py
automl = AutoML(mode="Explain")
```

It is aimed to be used when the user wants to explain and understand the data.
 - It is using 75%/25% train/test split. 
 - It uses: `Baseline`, `Linear`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Xgboost`, `Neural Network' algorithms, and ensemble. 
 - It has full explanations: learning curves, importance plots, and SHAP plots.

### Perform

```py
automl = AutoML(mode="Perform")
```

It should be used when the user wants to train a model that will be used in real-life use cases.
 - It uses a 5-fold CV.
 - It uses: `Linear`, `Random Forest`, `LightGBM`, `Xgboost`, `CatBoost`, and `Neural Network`. It uses ensembling. 
 - It has learning curves and importance plots in reports.

### Compete

```py
automl = AutoML(mode="Compete")
```

It should be used for machine learning competitions.
 - It adapts the validation strategy depending on dataset size and `total_time_limit`. It can be: a train/test split (80/20), 5-fold CV or 10-fold CV. 
 - It is using: `Linear`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Extra Trees`, `LightGBM`, `Xgboost`, `CatBoost`, `Neural Network`, and `Nearest Neighbors`. It uses ensemble and **stacking**. 
 - It has only learning curves in the reports.

### Optuna

```py
automl = AutoML(mode="Optuna", optuna_time_budget=3600)
```

It should be used when the performance is the most important and time is not limited.
- It uses a 10-fold CV
- It uses: `Random Forest`, `Extra Trees`, `LightGBM`, `Xgboost`, and `CatBoost`. Those algorithms are tuned by `Optuna` framework for `optuna_time_budget` seconds, each. Algorithms are tuned with original data, without advanced feature engineering.
- It uses advanced feature engineering, stacking and ensembling. The hyperparameters found for original data are reused with those steps.
- It produces learning curves in the reports.



## How to save and load AutoML?

All models in the AutoML are saved and loaded automatically. No need to call `save()` or `load()`.

### Example:

#### Train AutoML

```python
automl = AutoML(results_path="AutoML_classifier")
automl.fit(X, y)
```

You will have all models saved in the `AutoML_classifier` directory. Each model will have a separate directory with the `README.md` file with all details from the training.

#### Compute predictions
```python
automl = AutoML(results_path="AutoML_classifier")
automl.predict(X)
```

The  AutoML automatically loads models from the `results_path` directory. If you will call `fit()` on already trained AutoML then you will get a warning message that AutoML is already fitted.


### Why do you automatically save all models?

All models are automatically saved to be able to restore the training after interruption. For example, you are training AutoML for 48 hours, and after 47 hours, there is some unexpected interruption. In MLJAR AutoML you just call the same training code after the interruption and AutoML reloads already trained models and finishes the training.

## Supported evaluation metrics (`eval_metric` argument in `AutoML()`)

- for binary classification: `logloss`, `auc`, `f1`, `average_precision`, `accuracy`- default is `logloss`
- for multiclass classification: `logloss`, `f1`, `accuracy` - default is `logloss`
- for regression: `rmse`, `mse`, `mae`, `r2`, `mape`, `spearman`, `pearson` - default is `rmse`

If you don't find the `eval_metric` that you need, please add a new issue. We will add it.


## Fairness Aware Training

Starting from version `1.0.0` AutoML can optimize the Machine Learning pipeline with sensitive features. There are the following fairness related arguments in the AutoML constructor:
 - `fairness_metric` - metric which will be used to decide if the model is fair,
 - `fairness_threshold` - threshold used in decision about model fairness,
 - `privileged_groups` - privileged groups used in fairness metrics computation,
 - `underprivileged_groups` - underprivileged groups used in fairness metrics computation.

The `fit()` method accepts `sensitive_features`. When sensitive features are passed to AutoML, the best model will be selected among fair models only. In the AutoML reports, additional information about fairness metrics will be added. The MLJAR AutoML supports two methods for bias mitigation:
 - Sample Weighting - assigns weights to samples to treat samples equally,
 - Smart Grid Search - similar to Sample Weighting, where different weights are checked to optimize fairness metric.

The fair ML building can be used with all algorithms, including `Ensemble` and `Stacked Ensemble`. We support three Machine Learning tasks:
 - binary classification,
 - mutliclass classification,
 - regression.

Example code:


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from supervised.automl import AutoML

data = fetch_openml(data_id=1590, as_frame=True)
X = data.data
y = (data.target == ">50K") * 1
sensitive_features = X[["sex"]]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, S_train, S_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, sensitive_features, stratify=y, test_size=0.75, random_state=42
)

automl = AutoML(
    algorithms=[
        "Xgboost"
    ],
    train_ensemble=False,
    fairness_metric="demographic_parity_ratio",  
    fairness_threshold=0.8,
    privileged_groups = [{"sex": "Male"}],
    underprivileged_groups = [{"sex": "Female"}],
)

automl.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=S_train)
```

# Examples

## :point_right: Binary Classification Example

There is a simple interface available with `fit` and `predict` methods.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from supervised.automl import AutoML

df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pplonski/datasets-for-start/master/adult/data.csv",
    skipinitialspace=True,
)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df[df.columns[:-1]], df["income"], test_size=0.25
)

automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = automl.predict(X_test)
```

AutoML `fit` will print:
```py

# FAQ

<details><summary>What method is used for hyperparameters optimization?</summary>
  - For modes: `Explain`, `Perform`, and `Compete` there is used a random search method combined with hill climbing. In this approach, all checked models are saved and used for building Ensemble.
  - For mode: `Optuna` the Optuna framework is used. It uses using TPE sampler for tuning. Models checked during the Optuna hyperparameters search are not saved, only the best model is saved (the final model from tuning). You can check the details about checked hyperparameters from optuna by checking study files in the `optuna` directory in your AutoML `results_path`.
</details>

<details><summary>How to save and load AutoML?</summary>

The save and load of AutoML models is automatic. All models created during AutoML training are saved in the directory set in `results_path` (argument of `AutoML()` constructor). If there is no `results_path` set, then the directory is created based on following name convention: `AutoML_{number}` the `number` will be number from 1 to 1000 (depends which directory name will be free).

Example save and load:

```python
automl = AutoML(results_path='AutoML_1')
automl.fit(X, y)
```

The all models from AutoML are saved in `AutoML_1` directory.

To load models:

```python
automl = AutoML(results_path='AutoML_1')
automl.predict(X)
```

</details>

<details><summary>How to set ML task (select between classification or regression)?</summary>

The MLJAR AutoML can work with:
- binary classification
- multi-class classification
- regression

The ML task detection is automatic based on target values. There can be situation if you want to manually force AutoML to select the ML task, then you need to set `ml_task` parameter. It can be set to `'binary_classification'`, `'multiclass_classification'`, `'regression'`.

Example:
```python
automl = AutoML(ml_task='regression')
automl.fit(X, y)
```
In the above example the regression model will be fitted.

</details>

<details><summary>How to reuse Optuna hyperparameters?</summary>
  
  You can reuse Optuna hyperparameters that were found in other AutoML training. You need to pass them in `optuna_init_params` argument. All hyperparameters found during Optuna tuning are saved in the `optuna/optuna.json` file (inside `results_path` directory).
  
 Example:
 
 ```python
 optuna_init = json.loads(open('previous_AutoML_training/optuna/optuna.json').read())
 
 automl = AutoML(
     mode='Optuna',
     optuna_init_params=optuna_init
 )
 automl.fit(X, y)
 ```
  
 When reusing Optuna hyperparameters the Optuna tuning is simply skipped. The model will be trained with hyperparameters set in `optuna_init_params`. Right now there is no option to continue Optuna tuning with seed parameters.
  
  
</details>


<details><summary>How to know the order of classes for binary or multiclass problem when using predict_proba?</summary>

To get predicted probabilites with information about class label please use the `predict_all()` method. It returns the pandas DataFrame with class names in the columns. The order of predicted columns is the same in the `predict_proba()` and `predict_all()` methods. The `predict_all()` method will additionaly have the column with the predicted class label.
